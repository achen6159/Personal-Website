        <br><br><br>
        I am currently a junior at the University of Maryland, College Park with a major in Computer Science and minor in Asian American Studies. I have a passion for computer programming and the many applications it can be used for. Over my internship this past summer, I was able to learn and utilize data analysis and machine learning for an engineering company. I am always striving to learn new skills to keep myself challenged. My goal is to have an internship for next summer as a Full Stack Developer so that I can gain experience in multiple different areas.

        Experience:<br>
        As a Renewable Energy Engineering Intern at General Electric last summer, I contributed towards developing proprietary technology that would make wind turbines operate more efficiently and reliably through self-learning on an agile development team. I wrote Python/SQL scripts to analyze dataset (1 million values) in order to find prospective capacity value (~$20-60M) in 3-5 ISOs (Independent System Operators). I also created a random forest regression model with Sklearn using data collected from wind turbines to prove feasibility in acquiring potential earnings from grid demand for a potential product add-on (an application that can be deployed in the future).

        Interests:<br>
        I am very passionate about promoting diversity and empowering underrepresented genders in tech. I am currently the Director of Active Members for the Association for Women in Computing, an organization at school that “strives to promote inclusivity in STEM by giving underreprsented genders and allies in computing the platform to exceed”. My goal is to expand our community and foster a welcoming and inclusive environment for current and new members.
        <br>Aside from that, some of my hobbies include playing tennis and painting
